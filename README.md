cFIREsim-open
=============
Current Demo Available: https://alistair-marshall.github.io/cFIREsim-open/

Purpose:  This is a forked version of the cFiresim project, trying to refresh and update add more features.

All the old PHP code has been removed, there is no more server side processing. It is all clientside javascript.

Disclaimers:
- The goal is to write cFIREsim-open more or less completely in Javascript. 

- The origional maintainer hasn't done any updates since 2016

- I have a full-time job AND another for-fun programming project. This project originally took me months to develop.  With those things in mind, progress may be slow. 
	
Collaboration: Primary discussion of the project can be done here on the github issues page.
